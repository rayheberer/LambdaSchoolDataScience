# Assignment

The following [static site](https://wonderful-curran-bcc7b9.netlify.com/) is deployed by Netlify and contains the solution to the Week 4, Day 2 coding challenge.

# Basic Web Development at Lambda School

You might have noticed, the web is an important part of our industry. Medium posts, data visualization, colaborative environments, software libraries, new research, and so much more are all available directly on the web. You haven't entered Machine Learning through the "traditional" 12+ year academic path, and in many ways this is a blessing for your career. Instead of focusing on historical and hidden academic disciplines, you can dive right into the most visible and most relevant material of today.

This also means that you should be presenting yourself using the most visible and relevant material. Today's coding challenge is your first lesson on building your resume on the web.

Starting today, we'll be performing all of our research with the question, "How can I publish this to the internet?" in the back of our heads.
